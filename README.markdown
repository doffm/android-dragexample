# DragExample

This is an example android application that makes use of the
DragArea library avaiable at 
[https://github.com/doffm/android-dragarea](https://github.com/doffm/android-dragarea).

The DragArea repository is included as a submodule so this
repository will build stand-alone after cloning the submodules.

This can be done by calling `git submodule init` followed by
`git submodule update`.
